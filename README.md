# Bike Sharing


Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations located throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City, and Hoboken. 

Citi Bike is a fun and affordable way to get around town. It was designed with convenience in mind for quick trips. Citi Bike is frequently faster than other modes of transportation (particularly when traveling across town), and it is more convenient than owning a bike. Using Citi Bike instead of taxis can save you a lot of money. A year of Citi Bike is also less expensive than two monthly subway passes.

## Summary 

This data analysis provides insightful information for investors into the demand for bike renting businesses in New York which can be implemented in cities like Des Moines. It's clear there is a high demand for bikes, regardless of gender and it appears to be a popular method of transportation be it for day-to-day needs to more touristic uses.

Based on the data set provided, I would have conducted an analysis of hours where bikes were used the least, to plan out the most ideal time slots for maintenance of the bikes across the stations to ensure bikes are always ready to be checked out without inconveniencing users and customers.

Another analysis that can be useful to conduct would be to take into consideration the distances transited by users, and with this information try to set up a more efficient plan for stations that allow for more reachability for all commutes.
